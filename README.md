# comp-grafica-projs
In this repository you'll find the projects that I've developed as requirements for the Computer Graphics discipline. All the projects were made using the [ABCg library](https://github.com/hbatagelo/abcg), a wrapper for OpenGL provided by the instructors of the discipline. All the projects were developed using C++ and the WASM version was compiled using [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/). 

## Snake Game

The goal of this project is the implementation of the classic snake game (or, better known here in Brazil as “jogo da cobrinha”). The development of this project was useful for a better understanding of the OpenGL pipeline, the internals of the vertex rendering and to begin the studies of the shaders. In the figure 1 there is a picture of the game finished. [Link to Snake Game](https://guhserafs.github.io/comp-grafica-projs/abcg_snake_game/) 

## Testarossa

In this project we started the understand how to work with tridimensional objects, implementing the needed transformations using basic translational and rotational calculations. We also started to study more complex shaders. [Link to Testarossa](https://guhserafs.github.io/comp-grafica-projs/abcg_testarossa/)

The name of the project is an allusion to _Forza Horizon_. In this project the testarossa comes to life and can wander through a maze. We dived deeper in the linear algebra and physics needed to generate the transformations in the models and in the camera. We also experimented with different light shaders in the development of this project. [Link to Horizon](https://guhserafs.github.io/comp-grafica-projs/abcg_horizon/)
